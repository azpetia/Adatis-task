# Adatis-task

### Services to be provided by the Provider 
The Services governed by this SoW will be undertaken by a team of Consultants over approximately a three month duration.  
The Services will consist of the design and implementation of a new dimensional model, reports & dashboards with KPIs, some actual, some forecasts, derived through machine learning algorithms. The high level tasks in scope for this engagement are as follows:  
- Clean the presently dirty dataset. 
- Build a dimensional model star schema, using only facts and dimensions necessary to meet the KPI requirements. 
- One dashboard and two reports. 
- 8 new KPIs, 3 to be decided by the development team during the project, 5 defined below: 
   - Unique order count 
  - Average order amount in £ 
  - YTD internet sales in £ 
  - YTD shop sales in £ 
  - Online sales as a percentage of overall sales, excluding customer collections 
- Each KPI should also be predicted until May 2016 (3 months), using regression machine learning. 
- Another machine learning algorithm should be implemented to display some brand new insight, the details of this should be decided by the development team during the project. 
- The final solution must be presented in Power BI, a single Power BI pbix file will be evaluated. You may use R or Python integration to implement the machine learning algorithms. 
- The project will be tracked using scrum methodology using Azure DevOps and all code will be version controlled in GitHub.
